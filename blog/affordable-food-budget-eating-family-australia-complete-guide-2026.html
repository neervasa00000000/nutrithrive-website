                            <p>Moringa leaves are rich in vitamin C, vitamin A precursors, calcium, iron, and plant antioxidants, which may support overall nutrition, blood sugar and cholesterol control, and anti-inflammatory activity in people with poor diets. "Superfood" or "miracle tree" are marketing-style labels; human clinical data show modest benefits (for example, small improvements in blood sugar or lipids) rather than dramatic cures.</p>

                            <p>Small food-like amounts (for example, a teaspoon of powder in food) are generally considered acceptable for healthy adults, but there is no standard "must take" recommendation, and long-term high-dose safety is not well defined. Use is optional, not essential; if you do take it daily, choose reputable brands and monitor for side effects like digestive upset or changes in labs.</p>

                            <p>Leaves and powder have a grassy, slightly bitter, "green" taste due to plant compounds like polyphenols and glucosinolates; bitterness increases with older leaves and higher doses.</p>
