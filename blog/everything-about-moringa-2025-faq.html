      <h2>Top 20 Moringa Questions Answered</h2>
      
      <h3>1. What does Moringa taste like?</h3>
      <p>Mild, earthy, slightly grassy—similar to matcha or green tea. Much milder than spirulina.</p>

      <h3>2. Can I put Moringa in hot coffee?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but warm is better. Very high heat can degrade some nutrients. Let your coffee cool slightly before adding Moringa.</p>

      <h3>3. How do I store Moringa powder?</h3>
      <p>Keep it in a cool, dry place away from light. An airtight container in your pantry is perfect. It will stay fresh for up to 2 years.</p>

      <h3>4. Does Moringa expire?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but it has a long shelf life—typically 2 years when stored properly. Check the expiration date on your package.</p>

      <h3>5. Can I cook with Moringa?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely! Add it to soups, sauces, smoothies, baked goods, and more. Just avoid very high heat to preserve nutrients.</p>

      <h3>6. How much Moringa should I take daily?</h3>
      <p>Start with 1 teaspoon per day. You can increase to 1-2 tablespoons based on your needs and tolerance.</p>

      <h3>7. When is the best time to take Moringa?</h3>
      <p>Morning is popular for energy, but you can take it anytime. Some prefer it with meals to help with nutrient absorption.</p>

      <h3>8. Can kids take Moringa?</h3>
      <p>Yes, in smaller amounts. Start with 1/4 teaspoon for children. It's great for hiding in their food!</p>

      <h3>9. Is Moringa safe during pregnancy?</h3>
      <p>Consult your doctor first. While Moringa is generally safe, pregnancy requires extra caution with any supplement.</p>

      <h3>10. Does Moringa have caffeine?</h3>
      <p>No, Moringa is caffeine-free. It provides natural energy without the jitters or crash.</p>

      <h3>11. Can I take Moringa on an empty stomach?</h3>
      <p>Yes, many people do. If you experience any stomach sensitivity, try taking it with food.</p>

      <h3>12. Will Moringa make me gain weight?</h3>
      <p>No, Moringa is low in calories and can actually support weight management through appetite control and metabolism support.</p>

      <h3>13. How is Moringa different from matcha?</h3>
      <p>Moringa has more protein, iron, and Vitamin A. Matcha has caffeine; Moringa doesn't. Both are green superfoods with different benefits.</p>

      <h3>14. Can I mix Moringa with protein powder?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Moringa pairs well with protein powders and can boost the nutritional profile of your shake.</p>

      <h3>15. Does Moringa help with sleep?</h3>
      <p>Some people find it helps with sleep quality due to its magnesium content and adaptogenic properties, but it's not a sedative.</p>

      <h3>16. Is Moringa organic?</h3>
      <p>Look for certified organic Moringa. Our <a href="/products/product-detail.html" style="color:#2d5a3d;font-weight:600;">NutriThrive Moringa</a> is 100% organic and lab-tested.</p>

      <h3>17. Can I use Moringa in baking?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Add it to muffins, pancakes, bread, and cookies. It adds nutrients without significantly changing the taste.</p>

      <h3>18. Does Moringa interact with medications?</h3>
      <p>Moringa may interact with blood sugar and blood pressure medications. Always consult your doctor if you're on medication.</p>

      <h3>19. How do I know if my Moringa is high quality?</h3>
      <p>Look for: bright green color, fine powder texture, organic certification, and third-party lab testing. Our Moringa meets all these standards.</p>

      <h3>20. Can I take Moringa every day?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Daily use is recommended for best results. Consistency is key to experiencing the full benefits.</p>
