            <h2 class="section-title">The Science of Immune Health</h2>
            <p>
                According to the <a href="https://blog.totalwellbeingdiet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSIRO's Total Wellbeing Diet</a>, 
                a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants is key to supporting immune cells. Essential nutrients include 
                beta‑carotene, vitamins C, D and E, zinc and digestible fibre. These nutrients help reduce inflammation, stimulate 
                white‑blood‑cell production and protect against oxidative stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eating a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables ensures you get the broad range of micronutrients and 
                phytochemicals your body needs. Below are eight superfoods – many available in NutriThrive's range – that provide 
                potent immune‑boosting nutrients for Australians in 2025.

                    Moringa (NutriThrive)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Moringa oleifera is often dubbed the "miracle tree." A scientific review found that moringa leaves contain 
                    10 times more vitamin A than carrots, 7 times more vitamin C than oranges and 17 times more calcium than milk 
                    (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMC</a>). The leaves also supply significant 
                    quantities of protein, potassium and essential amino acids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers note that the presence of numerous minerals and vitamins in moringa helps to improve immunity against diseases. 
                    A 2025 meta‑analysis reported that moringa supplementation significantly increased CD4⁺ T‑cell counts in adults living with HIV; 
                    the effect is attributed to the abundance of vitamins A, C and E, zinc and polyphenols which stimulate T‑cell proliferation 
                    and scavenge free radicals (<a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontiers</a>).

                    Turmeric (Curcuma longa)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Turmeric is a golden spice prized in Ayurveda and modern science for its potent compound curcumin. Curcumin has been shown 
                    to improve gut health and the immune system (<a href="https://healthline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthline</a>), 
                    functioning as a natural anti‑inflammatory and antioxidant that helps neutralise free radicals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Antioxidants support the body's ability to fight infections, while curcumin's anti‑inflammatory effects may calm an 
                    overactive immune response. Combining turmeric with black pepper (which contains piperine) enhances curcumin absorption.

                    Ginger (Zingiber officinale)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ginger root contains active compounds like gingerol, shogaol, zingerone and paradol. These phytochemicals give ginger 
                    antioxidant, anti‑inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (<a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCBI</a>). 
                    Studies show that ginger is a source of numerous antioxidants and helps reduce oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide and 
                    hydroxyl radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ginger also suppresses pro‑inflammatory cytokines and down‑regulates inflammatory genes, supporting immune resilience.

                    Elderberry (Sambucus nigra)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Elderberries are rich in anthocyanins and other bioactive compounds. A review of elderberry's antiviral activity found that 
                    elderberry extract stimulates the immune system by enhancing cytokine production in monocytes and increasing expression of 
                    IL‑6, IL‑8 and TNF35 (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMC</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clinical trials show that elderberry preparations can reduce the duration and severity of respiratory viral infections when 
                    taken within 48 hours of symptom onset; participants experienced significant relief within 2–4 days. While more high‑quality 
                    trials are needed, elderberry's combination of antioxidants, vitamin C and immune‑modulating compounds makes it a valuable 
                    addition to the pantry.

                    Black Tea (NutriThrive)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Black tea is Australia's favourite cuppa, and it does more than wake you up. According to the 
                    <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland Clinic</a>, black tea is packed with 
                    flavonoids—polyphenols that act as antioxidants, minimise damage from free radicals and help fight inflammation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These antioxidants are important for a healthy immune system, assisting the body in fighting viruses, bacteria and infections. 
                    Black tea also contains the amino acid L‑theanine, which may aid relaxation without drowsiness.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Curry leaves are aromatic leaves used in South‑Asian and Indian‑Australian cooking. 
                    <a href="https://webmd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebMD</a> notes that curry leaves support immune health because 
                    they are rich in antioxidants; these compounds help prevent illnesses and can shorten the duration of sickness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are also excellent sources of vitamins C, A, E and B, providing micronutrients that maintain healthy skin and mucous 
                    membranes—our body's first lines of defence.

                <p>
                    Spirulina is a blue‑green algae touted for its nutrient density. <a href="https://medicalnewstoday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical News Today</a> 
                    reports that spirulina contains protein, vitamins (including B vitamins and vitamin C) and has antioxidant and inflammation‑fighting properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human studies show that spirulina supplementation increases antibody production, improving immunity and brain health. Although systematic 
                    reviews note that evidence is still limited, spirulina may help regulate the immune system and protect against exercise‑induced immune dysfunction.

                    Matcha (Camellia sinensis)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Matcha is a finely ground powder of shade‑grown green tea leaves. It contains high levels of catechins, particularly epigallocatechin 
                    gallate (EGCG), and other antioxidants. <a href="https://healthline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthline</a> notes that these 
                    compounds reduce inflammation, maintain healthy arteries and promote cell repair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matcha may contain up to ten times more antioxidants than regular green tea. The tea is also rich in L‑theanine, an amino acid that 
                    increases alpha waves in the brain, fostering relaxation and alertness while enhancing mood. Stress reduction and adequate sleep are 
                    critical for robust immunity, making matcha an indirect ally of the immune system.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The immune system is influenced by many factors, but nutrition remains one of the most accessible ways to support it. 
                Incorporating superfoods like moringa, turmeric, ginger, elderberry, black tea, curry leaves, spirulina and matcha into 
                your diet provides a rich mix of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and adaptogenic compounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                These foods not only bolster immune function but also contribute to overall wellbeing. As always, whole foods work best 
                alongside a balanced lifestyle—adequate sleep, regular movement and stress management remain central to thriving in 2025 and beyond.
