# Google Search Console Action Plan
## SEO Optimization Checklist for NutriThrive

### Step 1: Check Indexing Status (Critical)

**Location:** Google Search Console → Pages (under "Indexing" section)

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ **"Discovered - currently not indexed"** = Google found it but hasn't crawled yet (normal for new pages)
- ⚠️ **"Crawled - currently not indexed"** = Google read it but rejected it (DUPLICATE CONTENT WARNING)

**Action:** If you see many "Crawled - currently not indexed" pages, this confirms duplicate content issues. The consolidation we just did should fix this.

### Step 2: Force Google to Re-Scan (Do This Today)

**Location:** Google Search Console → Top search bar

**Priority Pages to Request Indexing (Top 5):**

1. **Moringa Benefits Master Guide**
   - URL: `https://nutrithrive.com.au/blog/moringa-powder-ultimate-superfood-guide-australian-health-2025.html`
   - Why: This is now your consolidated power page

2. **Curry Leaves Master Guide**
   - URL: `https://nutrithrive.com.au/blog/where-to-buy-dried-curry-leaves-melbourne-complete-local-buyers-guide.html`
   - Why: Consolidated from 4 duplicate articles

3. **Moringa vs Matcha (Melbourne)**
   - URL: `https://nutrithrive.com.au/blog/moringa-vs-matcha-superfood-comparison-melbourne-2025.html`
   - Why: Now the canonical version

4. **Homepage**

### Step 3: Quality Control - Reduce 67 to 40 Pages

**Current Status:** 67 discovered pages

**Target:** 40 high-quality pages

**What We've Done:**
- ✅ Deleted 4 duplicate articles (Moringa vs Matcha, 3 Curry Leaves)
- ✅ Added redirects to consolidate SEO juice

**Expected Result:** 
- Pages count should drop from 67 → ~63 (after redirects process)
- Continue consolidating thin/duplicate content
- Focus on creating fewer, stronger pages

**Pages to Consider Consolidating Next:**
- Multiple "where to buy" variations
- Multiple "benefits" articles (already redirecting to master)
- Similar "guide" articles that overlap

---

### Step 4: Check Performance Tab (Keyword Goldmine)

**Location:** Google Search Console → Performance → Queries

**What to Look For:**
- Keywords with **HIGH Impressions** but **LOW Clicks**
- Example: 1,000 impressions, 5 clicks = Ranking on Page 2-3

**Action Plan:**
1. Export the Queries report
2. Sort by Impressions (highest first)
3. Identify keywords with:
   - 100+ impressions
   - Click-through rate < 2%
   - These are your "Page 2" opportunities

**Optimization Strategy:**
For each high-impression, low-click keyword:
1. Find the page that's ranking for it
2. Add the exact keyword to:
   - H1 title (most important)
   - First paragraph
   - Meta title (if not already there)
   - At least one H2 or H3 subheading
