                    <h2 id="indian-cooking-staple">Indian Cooking Staple</h2>
                    <p>Curry leaves are fundamental in many Indian dishes. They are typically added to hot oil or ghee at the start of cooking ("tadka") to release their flavor and aroma. For example, popular dishes include lentil dal (sambar) and rasam, which begin with mustard seeds and plenty of curry leaves fried in oil.</p>

                    <p>Dried curry leaves can be used the same way – just crumble them into the oil. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/curry-leaves-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthline advises</a> that "dried curry leaves can last up to a year when kept in a vacuum-sealed bag" and recommends crumbling them over dishes as a flavoring. Many recipes double the amount of dried leaves compared to fresh, since dried leaves are less aromatic.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>💡 Pro Tip</h4>
                        <p>When using dried curry leaves, always double the amount compared to fresh leaves to compensate for the milder aroma. This ensures your dishes maintain the authentic flavor profile.</p>
                    </div>

                            <p>Yes! When using dried curry leaves, double the amount compared to fresh leaves to compensate for the milder aroma. Crumble them into hot oil during tempering for best results.</p>
